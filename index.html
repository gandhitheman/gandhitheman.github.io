            The book: <a href="https://americanmeditation.org/product/gandhi-the-man/">Gandhi the Man: How one man changed himself to change the world</a>, by Eknath Easwaran.
            <br /><br />
            Another: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Soldier_of_Islam">Nonviolent soldier of Islam: Badshah Khan</a>, by Eknath Easwaran.
            A riveting tale of the spiritual transformation of a militant Islamic tribe through a deepening of understanding of Islam.

            <h2>Ahimsa</h2>

            Non-violence in deed, word or thought. When we harbor ill will for another, even if we do not act physically, this is not ahimsa.
            
            <h2>Practical advice</h2>
            
            <p>
            Above all: be kind (to all -- no exceptions). Be brave. Be skillful.
            </p>
            
            <p>Treat difficult situations as opportunities for growth and skill development.</p>

            <p>Learn to entertain the views of others without being overcome by them.</p>

            <p>Replace the reflex to judge with one to understand.</p>

            <p>To change the world, redirect energy rather than trying to create or destroy it.</p>

            <p>Love means understanding (Thich Nhat Han).</p>

            <p>Spirituality increases resilience in all dimensions of life.</p>

            <p>Ill will, even towards the most heinous troublemakers, only interferes with one's ability to effect change.</p>

            
            <h2>To ponder with an open mind</h2>

            <p>Isn't it dangerous to relinquish condemnation of bad actors? Doesn't this make more space for their harmful actions?</p>

            <p>Does employing the ways of Gandhi require a specific religious faith?</p>

            <p>How can you justify sitting around meditating when the world is on fire?</p>

            <p>Seeking moksha sounds like completely checking out from the world. How can this benefit the world? Is this really what moksha is?</p>

            <h2>Gandhi quotes</h2>

            <p>It is not nonviolence if we merely love those that love us. It is nonviolence only when we love those that hate us. I know how difficult it is to follow this grand law of love. But are not all great and good things difficult to do?</p>

            <p>Disobedience to be civil must be sincere, respectful, restrained, never defiant, must be based upon some well-understood principle, must not be capricious and, above all, must have no ill will or hatred behind it."</p>
            
            <p>True nonviolence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness.</p>

            <p>I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world.</p>

            <p>In this age of wonders no one will say that a thing or an idea is worthless because it is new. To say it is impossible because it is difficult, is again not in consonance with the spirit of the age. Things undreamt of are daily being seen, the impossible is ever becoming possible. We are constantly being astonished these days at the amazing discoveries of the field of violence. But I maintain that far more undreamt of and seemingly impossible discoveries will be made in the field of nonviolence.</p>
