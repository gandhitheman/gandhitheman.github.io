            <h2>Ahimsa</h2>

            Non-violence in deed, word or thought. When we wish ill upon another, even if we do not act physically, this is violence.
            
            <h2>Hindu concepts relevant to Gandhi's spirituality</h2>

            <p>Atman</p>

            <p>Yoga. Yoga is not only the way of poses. In the yoga sutras Patanjali (ca. 500 BCE) defines yoga as the cessation of the movements of the "mind-stuff" (1.ii)</p>

            <p>Karmayogi. A yogi that acts in the world.</p>

            <p>Moksha. Nirvana or enlightenment. A state of mind in which one is liberated from the illusion of the separateness of things and in which one's understanding of the universe becomes unclouded.</p>
                
            <p>Sakama and nishkama. In Hinduism all actions can be performed in one of two states of mind. Either with desire (sakama) or without desire (nishkama). In the latter all action flows not with the goal of reaping reward, as we so often motivate ourselves in our lives, but like a piece of music, freely, spontaneously, compassionately without any goal or end but as part of the unified flow of nature.
            One of the ultimate goals of meditation is to perform all actions in a state of nishkama, which frees us from the emotional fluctuations caused by the illusions of loss and gain and sets in harmony with our true nature.</p>
