            <h1>Gandhi and Ahimsa</h1>

            <p>
            What makes some movements for humanity's greater good more effective than others?
            To answer this question there is perhaps no better case study to turn to than Gandhi.
            Our modern approach toward social change can be largely traced to the sit-ins and other nonviolent ways championed by Gandhi during the movements he led in South Africa and India, which ultimately led to the freeing of India from British rule via a route relatively free of violent conflict.
            Gandhi also had a tremendous global influence, directly inspiring leaders of foundational civil rights movements.
            Martin Luther King Jr described Gandhi's philosophy as "the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom," and adopted a powerful notion of nonviolence (ahimsa) as a guiding light of the U.S. Civil Rights movement.
            In its original sanskrit, Ahimsa is described as nonviolence in thought, word, or deed.
            Thus, true nonviolence is not only absence of physical force but even of negative thoughts about one's opponent.
            In Gandhi's spiritual system this follows from grasping the unified nature of all of reality, the realization that while we may often think of ourselves as separate entities it is just as valid to think of ourselves as one.
            From the latter perspective it does not even make any sense to think poorly of another, no matter how unhinged their actions and ideas may be, since that is no more sensible than one part of a grand organism thinking less of another.
            King, too, understood this profound principle that even internal violence must be avoided, not only for peace of mind but for effective action toward justice: "The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent but he also refuses to hate him."

            <h2>Ahimsa</h2>

            Non-violence in deed, word or thought. When we harbor ill will for another, even if we do not act physically, this is not ahimsa.
            
            <h2>Hindu concepts relevant to Gandhi's spirituality</h2>

            <p>Atman</p>

            <p>Yoga. Yoga is not only the way of poses. In the yoga sutras Patanjali (ca. 500 BCE) defines yoga as the cessation of the movements of the "mind-stuff" (1.ii)</p>

            <p>Karmayogi. A yogi that acts in the world.</p>

            <p>Moksha. Nirvana or enlightenment. A state of mind in which one is liberated from the illusion of the separateness of things and in which one's understanding of the universe becomes unclouded.</p>
                
            <p>Sakama and nishkama. In Hinduism all actions can be performed in one of two states of mind. Either with desire (sakama) or without desire (nishkama). In the latter all action flows not with the goal of reaping reward, as we so often motivate ourselves in our lives, but like a piece of music, freely, spontaneously, compassionately without any goal or end but as part of the unified flow of nature.
            One of the ultimate goals of meditation is to perform all actions in a state of nishkama, which frees us from the emotional fluctuations caused by the illusions of loss and gain and sets in harmony with our true nature.</p>

            <h2>Practical advice</h2>
            
            <p>
            Be kind.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Be brave.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Be skillful.
            </p>

            <p>Treat difficult situations as opportunities for growth and skill development.</p>

            <p>Learn to entertain the views of others without being overcome by them.</p>

            <p>Replace the reflex to judge with one to understand.</p>

            <p>To change the world, redirect energy rather than trying to create or destroy it.</p>

            <p>Love means understanding (Thich Nhat Han).</p>

            <p>Spirituality increases resilience in all dimensions of life.</p>

            <p>Ill will, even towards the most heinous troublemakers, only interferes with one's ability to effect change.</p>

            
            <h2>To ponder with an open mind</h2>

            <p>Isn't it dangerous to relinquish condemnation of bad actors? Doesn't this make more space for their harmful actions?</p>

            <p>Does employing the ways of Gandhi require a specific religious faith?</p>

            <p>How can you justify sitting around meditating when the world is on fire?</p>

            <p>Seeking moksha sounds like completely checking out from the world. How can this benefit the world? Is this really what moksha is?</p>

            <h2>Gandhi quotes</h2>

            <p>It is not nonviolence if we merely love those that love us. It is nonviolence only when we love those that hate us. I know how difficult it is to follow this grand law of love. But are not all great and good things difficult to do?</p>

            <p>Disobedience to be civil must be sincere, respectful, restrained, never defiant, must be based upon some well-understood principle, must not be capricious and, above all, must have no ill will or hatred behind it."</p>
            
            <p>True nonviolence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness.</p>

            <p>I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world.</p>

            <p>In this age of wonders no one will say that a thing or an idea is worthless because it is new. To say it is impossible because it is difficult, is again not in consonance with the spirit of the age. Things undreamt of are daily being seen, the impossible is ever becoming possible. We are constantly being astonished these days at the amazing discoveries of the field of violence. But I maintain that far more undreamt of and seemingly impossible discoveries will be made in the field of nonviolence.</p>
